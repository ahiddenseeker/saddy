Atlas Generator
A program for automatic generation of configs and texture atlases for saddy
Suppose, you have an input xml file like
          <sprites config="a.xml" texture="a.png" >
          <a texture="aa.png" size="64;64" transparent="0;0;0" index="2" />
          ...
          </sprites>  
You want to merge aa.png with other texture into a texture atlas (POT texture) 
converting it to a saddy XML config format and write atlas into a.png and config - a.xml
This is where this script comes in handy. Also you can omit size tag - it can be taken from size of source image file
and transparent - to make texture part non-transparent. By default index is "0", so you could omit it too.
The resulting config will be like 
       <sprites>
       <a texture="a.png" size="64;64" transparent="0;0;0" index="2"  texrect="0;0;w;h"/>
       ...
       </sprites>
So, you can load new texture by loading it in saddy engine and parsingfile, resulting a texture atlas.
 
You can run the program using atlasgen-debug [--format-xml|--format-json] "name of valid config"
